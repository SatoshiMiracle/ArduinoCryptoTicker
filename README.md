Cool code that can be used for building a cryptocurrency price ticker tool using Python and Arduino.

Simple Requirements:
1) pySerial Python Library
2) Binance Python API Library. (https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance)
3) Storing your Binance API keys in the config.py file as strings. (This is a local file that doesn't risk you secret keys)
4) Make sure to have the right COM port in dataSender.py

5) Any Arduino computer, I personally used a Nano
6) 16x2 LCD screen
7) Red & Green LEDs
8) A buzzer

After you configure the software side as noted above, connect the Arduino to your computer with a USB cable.

Have Fun!!!!
