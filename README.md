Cool code that can be used for building a cryptocurrency price ticker tool using Python and Arduino.

Simple Requirements:
1) pySerial Python Library.
2) Binance Python API Library. (https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance)
3) Storing your Binance API keys in the config.py file as strings. (This is a local file that doesn't risk you secret keys)
4) Make sure to have the right COM port in dataSender.py.

After you configure the software side as noted above, connect the Arduino to your computer with a USB cable.

Have Fun!!!!
